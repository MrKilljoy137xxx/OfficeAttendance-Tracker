<details closed><summary>1. Introduction 🏫</summary>

## Overview

**Office Attendance Tracker** is a web-based application that is lightweight and intended to simplify the administration of employee attendance.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are implemented to construct the application.  The application enables users to sign in and out, view attendance history, and generate reports from a clean, responsive interface.

This app is ideal for: 

* **Department for Education (DfE) Colleagues** who require a rapid and effortless method to monitor their attendance records and record their working hours.
* **Senior Civil Servants (SCSs)** who are responsible for monitoring the attendance of their employees and ensuring that they are fulfilling their attendance goals.
* **Developers** seeking a front-end attendance solution that can be customised. 

## Key Features 🔑

* Real-time check-in/check-out functionality
* Daily and monthly attendance summaries
* Exportable data (CSV support)
* Fully responsive design for desktop

## Design Principles

I was required to consider the application of deliberate design principles before creating the software designs. This will guarantee that the app is accessible and usable for all users within the DfE.  I have taken into account the following main principles:

**Clarity** was the initial principle that I examined.  This is the point at which I needed to guarantee that the user interface was both intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.  Additionally, I was required to guarantee that the office attendance rates of my users could be calculated and recorded through the use of distinct labels, buttons, and icons.

**Consistency** was the second principle that I evaluated.  This is the point at which I was required to adhere to common UI patterns, such as placing buttons at the bottom, and to maintain a consistent layout, typefaces, and colours across all pages.

**Accessibility** is the third design principle that I would prioritise.  This is the point at which I was required to guarantee that the keyboard navigation functioned properly and that the colour contrast between the text and the background was sufficient.  I was able to identify two colleagues in the department who had accessibility requirements and the corresponding colour scheme and font style to assist in addressing their needs.  I will elaborate on this later.

## User Personas & Empathy Maps

**User personas** are detailed, fictional representations of the target users of my application.  They will assist me in comprehending the demands, behaviours, objectives, and pain points of my users in order to guarantee that my application is tailored to their specific requirements. They are crucial because they will assist me in designing with empathy, concentrating on the actual requirements of the user rather than making assumptions.  I will be able to create an intuitive user experience by customising the interface and interactions to specific user categories, which will assist me in prioritising features and enhancing the UX.

Two distinct categories of users have been considered through the use of user personas: one who is a SCS and another who is a typical DfE colleague.  The user personas have been used to identify the specific accessibility requirements and pain points of both colleagues.

The design process will be facilitated by the creation of two empathy maps that pertain to both colleagues.  An **empathy map** is a collaborative visualisation tool that is employed to express the thoughts, emotions, words, and actions of a user in relation to the Office Attendance Tracker product.  This will facilitate the development of a more profound shared comprehension of their users among myself and my team.
